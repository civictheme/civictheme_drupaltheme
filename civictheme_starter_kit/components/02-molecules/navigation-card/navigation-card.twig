 * @file
 * Navigation Card component (extension of CivicTheme's component).
 *
 * Demonstration of adding an extension of the existing molecule-level
 * component.
 *
 * This component is based on CivicTheme's Navigation Card component.
 *
 * It extends Navigation Card component by adding 'tags' property. This template
 * provides support to render this new property.
 *
 * Note the use of the @ct-<COMPONENT_TYPE> namespace: it gives access
 * to the unmodified CivicTheme component template enabling us to override
 * secions of a component while preserving the other parts of the component to
 * rely on the CivicTheme component implementation. This is useful when only a
 * small portion of the component should be overridden.
 *
 * There are CivicTheme namespaces for:
 *  - base
 *  - atoms
 *  - molecules
 *  - organisms
 *  - templates
 *  - pages
 *
 * Variables:
 * - theme: [string] Theme: light, dark.
 * - content_top: [string] Content slot.
 * - image_over: [string] Content slot for image over.
 * - content_middle: [string] Content slot.
 * - content_bottom: [string] Content slot.
 * - size: [string] Size: large, small.
 * - image: [object] Image object:
 *   - src: [string] Image source.
 *   - alt: [string] Image alt text.
 * - image_as_icon: [boolean] Show image as an icon.
 * - icon: [string] Icon name.
 * - title: [string] The text of card title.
 * - summary: [string] Summary of the card.
 * - url: [string] Link.
 * - is_external: [boolean] Link is external or not.
 * - tags: [array] Array of tags. THIS IS A NEW PROPERTY ADDED FOR THIS EXAMPLE.
 * - modifier_class: [string] Additional classes.

  Twig {% block %} allows to extend a component by overriding only a part of it
  (defined as a block).

  Most of the CivicTheme components have {% block %} sections.
#}
{% block content_bottom %}
  {#
    Add rendering of a new preperty 'tags'.

    Note how Tag component is used from the default '@atom' namespace: if Tag
    component will be overridden in this theme - the override will be used; if
    not - CivicTheme's Tag component implementation will be used (which is the
    case in this example).
  #}
  {% if tags %}
    <div class="ct-promo-card__tags">
      {% for tag in tags %}

          text: tag,
