# CivicTheme Drupal theme

----

Version: `1.2.0`

## Introduction

CivicTheme theme, the Drupal theme built using a standalone component library,
provides components and data structures to enhance editorial experiences
out-of-the-box.

The [standalone component library](https://github.com/salsadigitalauorg/civictheme_library)
is a CMS-agnostic HTML/CSS/JS framework based on Atomic Design principles.

The Drupal theme provides full integration with a library.

## Installation

    composer require salsadigitalauorg/civictheme

Enable CivicTheme theme to use it as-is - CivicTheme component library is
already included as a set of compiled assets.

## Creating a sub-theme from the CivicTheme theme

CivicTheme provides a starter theme and a script to generate a child theme for
you to get started with.

Run the following command from within `civictheme` theme directory:

    php civictheme_create_subtheme.php <theme_machine_name> "Human theme name" "Human theme description" /path/to/theme_machine_name

This will generate a sub-theme in 'path/to/theme_machine_name' theme directory
with everything ready to be installed and compiled.

## Setting Brand colors via Drush command

Brand colors can be set using a Drush command

    ./vendor/bin/drush --include=path/to/civictheme/src/Drush civictheme:set-brand-colors light_brand1 light_brand2 light_brand3 dark_brand1 dark_brand2 dark_brand3

Example

    ./vendor/bin/drush --include=docroot/themes/contrib/civictheme/src/Drush civictheme:set-brand-colors "#00698f" "#e6e9eb" "#121313" "#61daff" "#003a4f" "#00698f"

Dynamic assets can be purged:

    ./vendor/bin/drush --include=docroot/themes/contrib/civictheme/src/Drush civictheme:clear-cache


## Compiling sub-theme assets

Run the following command from within your sub-theme directory:

    npm run build
