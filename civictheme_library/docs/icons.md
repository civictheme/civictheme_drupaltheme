# Icons

CivicTheme component library provides an expansive range of icons that are open
source and can be re-used within the child theme.

** Important note: Icons must be manually included within the child theme to
be utilised**

## Including icons within the child theme

CivicTheme component library stores icons in the `civictheme_library/assets/icons`
directory split into subdirectory libraries.

Copy and paste the icon svg file you wish to include in the starter kit from
their `civictheme_library/assets/icons/<icon-pack>` icon
pack directory into their respective `<child-theme>/assets/icons/<icon-pack>`
directory.

** Important note icons in child themes must be in the corresponding <icon-pack>
directory of CivicTheme library otherwise CivicTheme templates won't be able to reference
the required icon. **

We recommend not deleting any of the default icons found in the starter theme as
these are used by CivicTheme theme in the default templates.

## Troubleshooting icons

If you are experiencing a missing icon in your drupal webpage and the SVG tag is
not being rendered ie `div.ct-icon` does not have any inner SVG element -
this is caused by the icon svg missing from your child theme. Follow the above
process to include it.
